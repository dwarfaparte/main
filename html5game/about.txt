Dwarfaparte is a one man indie game developer from the United States, super into turn based strategy and 4x. Board games are a huge influence, especially Root, Imperial, John Company and War of the Ring. 

Beard of Stone is Dwarfaparte's first big boy game. It can take awhile to learn all that's necessary to develop games solo. Thankfully music and art were hobbies earlier in life. 

The concept of Beard of Stone was born out of thinking about how slow turn based bidding can be in board games, and why there hasn't been any notable PC games with bidding mechanics (besides Offworld Trading Company). I felt bidding could be brought into a real time format to make things snappy, while still keeping the rest of the game turn based. 

Secondarily, Beard of Stone had to be fantasy, because fantasy 4x is my favorite thing. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 was an early obsession and Age of Wonders 3 really hooked me more recently. I spent time looking for more and just couldn't find all that much (Master of Magic just too old to be enjoyable now, etc). 

I hope to support Beard of Stone for with lots of additional content, and or course have some ideas bubbling for future projects!
